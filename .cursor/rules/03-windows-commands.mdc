# Windows-first command rules (MUST FOLLOW)

- The default developer environment is Windows 11 (PowerShell).
- Do NOT output bash-only commands (e.g. `cd &&`, `export`, `rm -rf`, `grep`, `sed`, `cat`, `lsof`, `pkill`).
- When you need to run commands, provide PowerShell equivalents.
- Prefer `go` commands that don't require changing directories:
  - Use `go run ./cloud/cmd/server ...` instead of `cd cloud && go run ...`
  - Use `go test ./...` from repo root
- For process management on Windows:
  - find port: `netstat -ano | findstr :8080`
  - kill process tree: `taskkill /PID <pid> /F /T`
- If a cross-platform script is needed, implement it in Go under `scripts/` (preferred),
  or provide both PowerShell and bash variants explicitly labeled.
